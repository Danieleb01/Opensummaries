# Opensummaries
Progetto TecnologieWeb


## Overview

Opensummaries is an evolving initiative born from the "Progetto TecnologieWeb" of the web technologies course at the University of Naples, designed to facilitate the sharing of educational resources, specifically lecture and university notes. Currently, it focuses on the computer science courses at the Parhenope University of Naples, but it has been architecturally conceived for scalability. This foresight allows for potential expansion to include a broader range of courses and subjects. The project is currently in its beta phase, addressing challenges related to timing and delivery. Its adaptable framework also positions it as a prototype for other universities interested in establishing a similar system for exchanging academic notes.
